only trorn the single play which he had before him, but else from his
general knowledge ot the werke ct Menander and the other authors

admitted. Varro’s judgment was: Ie etherio Terentius poscit palmam.
“A close atudy,'' says Parry, “will rerily that both in the groupiug
and the treatment ot' hie characters, Terence ia an originales cenr-
pared with Plautus, and'trom the hints we can glean from the ecattered
fragmenta cf the Greek ecmedlans, we mey conclude that he was in a
great measure original, even when compared with Menender.” And
Mommsen remarks that “while Plautus points his oharacters with brood
strokes, often after astook model, Terence handlee the psychologicel
development with a carelul and osten excellent miniature peinting.”

The complaint has sometimes been made that Terence was deficient
in comio soree, end that he laoked the livoliness, freshness, end versa-
tility ot Plautus. Mommsen's language is that ‘he reproduoed the
agreeablenese without the merriment ot Menander! And in support

cf this allegatiou the famous epigram ot' Caesar, preservedby Sue-
tonius, hasbeen often quoted:
