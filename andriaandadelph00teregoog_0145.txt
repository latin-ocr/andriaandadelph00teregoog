culture at the hands ot' Ennius, “tha father aud princeos Roman
peetry.” Evcn the drama, in its earliest rude form ol translations oi
Greek plays by Livius Andronicus, had its beginninglonly about hall
s century before his hirth; the first eminent tragedian, Pacuvius, was
his contemporary, and hut three writers ot comedy had preceded him
-Cn. Naevius, Plautus, and Caecilius Statius. 'l'e Caecilius, then at
the haedos his profession, Terence was referred by the curule aediles,
ou odering his first play to them ror exhibition, at the age ol sixteen.
As ths story ran, he began the reading ot it seated near the table at
which the critic and his friends were dining. Ile had not proceeded
sar, when Caecilius, delighted with the characteres the work, invited
him to joiu the party at the seast; sudaster it was over, the remainder
os the play was read, highly approved by the audience, and recom-
mcuded to the aediles. Though it was not acted ior two years, copies
ol it were in simulatice, and the author was very soon brought into
intimate friendship with Scipio Aemilianus and Laelius, young men
ol' about the sarae age with himself, und already enthusiastic students
ol Greek literature. Through thern ho also gained the acquaintance
ot' the Aemilii, the Metelli, the Scaevolae, audather learned and inllu-
cntial families‚ as well as that oi the prinoipal literary men. A rumor·
soon started, and was circulated by his rivale, that he was aided in the
composition oi his plays by his patrans, and even that they were the
real authors. Cicero (ad All. v11. 3) and Quintilian (X. 1, 100) state,
without, however, endorsing these reperte, that they were generally
supposed to refer to Scipio and Laelius ς while Santra, a grammarian
and contemporary of Cicero, is quoted as remarking that, if the poet
, had needed aid, he would not have applied to those noblemen, on ac-
count of their youth, but to such men as Q. Fabius Labeo, M. Popillius
Laenas, or 1.. Sulpicius Galus, who were already distinguished ior their
learning. This entire supposition, however, is a mere conjecture, un· ἢ
supported by aparticle oi proof. The argument against it, from ³
internal evidence, is thus stated by Parry: “A earelul consideration
ol Terence's plays leads us to the conclusion that they are the produc-
tion ol a writer not only thoroughly educated, but having a consistent
theory ol dramatio composition. Add to this the remarkable purity of
the langcage, and we cannot, without a violent inconsisteucy, suppose
that this was the result os the patchwork contributione ol two or three
- dilettunti noblemen. These plays are so even and consistent through-
out, individually and with one another, having the same neatness ol ,
language, the same attention to metra-the some quiet tone of good-
atared humor and practical knowledge ol the world, that we might
