INTRODUOTION.

Tua very little that is known ot the lise ot Pontius Tanaurrus Arsa
is obtained chiefly from an extract from the Dc Poetis of Suetonius,
preserved by the grammarian Aelius Donatus (fl. A. D. 350) in the
introduction to his commentary on the comedies of this author.

According to this account, Terence was a native of Carthago, as
would also be inferred from his cognomen, and was brought to Rome a
slave in his childhood, having been perhaps taken prisoner at some
inroad made by the Numidians into Carthaginien territory. There he
came into the possessiones Terentius Lucanus, a senator, who educated
and then emancipated him, tho freedman, according tocustom, taking
the gentilia name of his patron.

If the reading of Suetonius’ text, now most approved, be correct,
Terence was born B. G. 184, the year of Plautus's death—the only
other Roincn writer of comedies whose works are extant— and the first

loo, he died the next year, in Arcadia or Leucadia, ot an illness caused
by grief at the loss at sea of a number of his translations of Greek
plays, or, according to another report, by shipwreck on his return·
voyage to Italy. His brief life thus fell within the first half os the
second century B. 0., in the interval between the victory of the Romans
ovar Antiochus the Groat and their final struggle against Carthage-
the period in which, by their wars against Perseus, the Ligariana ·
Spaniards, aud Sardiniens, they were complcting that circuit ot con-
quest which brought to the State and to individual citizens vast wealth,
but in its train politioal corruption, a rapid deterioration of morals, and ,
the decline of the nation's greatness.

Though the Greek language had been generally well known sor a
century, aad the Greek dramatists wore popular at Rome as early as
the second Punic war, there was no proso literature in Latin prior to

Terenoe's day, and the language had just been receiving its tirst rea'
