well defy any critic to show where Terence left off and his friends
began.'’ The story can be explained by the fact of literary jealousy,
tha hostility of the conservative faction in literature led by Cato and
the Fabii ιο every prominent writer in tha opposita party, and, per-
haps, in part also, hy the strong prejudices of the Romans against

freedmen and foreigners‚ which even Horace experienced. ln hie
allusione to this accusation in the prologues of the Hootoo linior-omeliae

(l. 22-25), and of the Adelploe (l. 15-21), Terence does not indeed
deny it, in the former leaving the question of its truth to tha judgruent
of his hearers, and in the latter insisting that if it were true, he ought
tc feel prend of it rather than uehemed3 but his evasion of the charge
can be accounted for on the ground that it was impolitic for him to
deny that which would be so creditahle, and therefore flutteriug, to his
patrans, while it would of course be reudily admitted that he may have
read his plays to them, and have availed himself of their criticisms.
The names of Terence’s comedies in the order in which they are
believed to have been written are: The Andria or Woman of Andros, ,
The Hecyra or Mothar-in-law, The Eunuchos, Tha Houtoo timorome-
aos or Self-Tormentor, The Phormio or Parasite, and tha Adelphos or
Brothers. It has been the fashion to charge him with being a copyist

in the preparation of these plays, but this charge has been pressed too
closely. Even Mommsen admits that “ by the literal adherence of his

imitatione ιο the originale we are not to understand a verbal transla-
tion in our sense.” Tor these productione he did not indeed alaim
originality in the striot sense of that term. In common with all tho
playwrights of his day, it was simply his aim to reproduce in Latin
the best works of the Attio comedy, or rather to construet plays inde-
pendentlyout of the camyron Greek materiale. Four of them are
founded upon comedies of Menander, the most eminent of the poete of
the New Comedy (whose works are not now extant), and the other two
upon comedies of Apollodorus of Carystus in Euboea; and his indebted-
ness to these writers is distinctly and fully aoknowlcdgad in his pro-
logues. He may, however, justly claim the merit of great artaud some
inventive power in the skill with which he combined two or more
Greek plays into one, and in his treatment of his characters. 'l'he
practice of contaminorinp plays, as it was called, was a common one
with the early Roman poeta and Terence formed the plots of four of
his plays in this way. But in this work he was no mera compilor.
. Parry, who has carelully examined all the extant fragments of Me-
nander, expresses the opinion that Terence “ cannot simply have dore-
tailed his new matter into tha cristing plot, but must, to a grestensis,
have rseast tha whole. The krroron variatione from the original extr
